FIX ASCII PROTOCOL
=======================

The Financial Information eXchange (FIX) protocol (https://www.fixtrading.org/)
is a standard electronic communications protocol for international real-time 
exchange of information related to securities transactions and markets.  

The FIX standard defines a set of protocols which can be organized in two
classes: ASCII protocols and binary protocols. This plugin (fix4_fixt)
implements a subset of the FIX standard based on the ASCII protocols. 
For support of FIX binary protocols, refer to the companion FIX/SOFH plugin 
(fix_sofh). 

NOTE: because the FIX ASCII protocol specification uses its own linebreaker 
delimiter, this analyzer requires a version of BinPAC that supports the 
&linebreaker attribute. You can get this BinPAC feature from this branch:

https://github.com/reservoirlabs/binpac/tree/feature/linebreaker

Some of the protocol specifications supported by this analyzer include:

- FIX 4.2, FIX 4.4 and FIXT 1.1 Session Protocols with tagvalue Encodings (both
  detection and validation).
- Extraction of FIX/FIXT Session Protocol BeginString, BodyLength and MsgType.
- Extraction of FIX/FIXT Session ProtocolSenderCompID, TargetCompIDassociated with 
  logon messages.
- FIX/FIXT Session Protocol spanning multiple TCP packets using the BinPAC attribute
  linebreaker (see NOTE above).
- Events generated: fix_detected(), fix_validated(), fix_logon().
